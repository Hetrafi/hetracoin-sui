# HetraCoin Audit Readiness Document

## Overview

This document serves as a guide for security auditors reviewing the HetraCoin Sui Move implementation. It outlines the system architecture, security model, and critical areas that should receive focused attention during the audit process.

## System Architecture

HetraCoin consists of several interconnected modules:

- **HetraCoin Module**: Core token implementation and admin management
- **Governance Module**: Admin capability management and token supply control
- **Treasury Module**: Timelock-protected fund management
- **Escrow Module**: P2P transaction security with dispute resolution
- **Staking Module**: Token staking with reward mechanics
- **LiquidityPool Module**: DEX-like swap functionality
- **Proposal Module**: On-chain governance system
- **Hetrafi Module**: External integration endpoints

## Security Model

HetraCoin implements a comprehensive security model:

### Capability-Based Security

- **AdminRegistry**: Central registry for admin address validation
- **TreasuryCap**: Sui standard capability for minting/burning
- **EmergencyPauseState**: Controls system-wide pause functionality

### Critical Security Mechanisms

1. **Two-Phase Admin Transfers**: Requires explicit acceptance by the new admin
2. **Emergency Pause**: Admin-triggered system pause for incident response
3. **Treasury Timelock**: Enforced delay period for treasury withdrawals
4. **Event Transparency**: All sensitive operations emit events
5. **AI-Enhanced Dispute Resolution**: Structured verification for escrow disputes

## Priority Focus Areas

### 1. Admin Capability Security

The admin capability flow is central to HetraCoin's security model:

- **HetraCoin.move**: Lines 50-100 implement the `AdminRegistry` with capability validation
- **Governance.move**: Lines 20-60 handle admin capability verification for token operations
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `HetraCoin::change_admin`
  - `HetraCoin::accept_admin`
  - `Governance::transfer_treasury_cap`

Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that all privileged operations properly validate admin capabilities.

### 2. Minting Control

Token supply integrity is maintained through:

- **Governance.move**: Lines 100-150 implement mint/burn operations
- **Access Control**: All minting requires proper admin capability verification
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `Governance::mint`
  - `Governance::burn`

Verify that no unauthorized minting is possible and that proper event emission occurs.

### 3. Treasury Timelock Verification

Fund security relies on timelock mechanisms:

- **Treasury.move**: Lines 50-120 implement the timelock verification
- **Withdrawal Flow**: Request → Timelock → Execution
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `Treasury::request_withdrawal`
  - `Treasury::execute_withdrawal`

Ensure that timelock periods cannot be bypassed and that only authorized parties can execute withdrawals.

### 4. Escrow Dispute Resolution

The escrow system includes enhanced dispute resolution:

- **Escrow.move**: Lines 150-250 handle the dispute flow
- **AI Review**: Structured evidence validation through external verification
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `Escrow::initiate_dispute`
  - `Escrow::resolve_dispute`

Verify proper authorization and state transitions during the dispute flow.

### 5. Emergency Pause Implementation

System-wide pause functionality:

- **HetraCoin.move**: Lines 250-300 implement the pause mechanism
- **Impact**: Critical operations should check pause state
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `HetraCoin::pause_system`
  - `HetraCoin::unpause_system`

Confirm that all sensitive operations respect the pause state and that only authorized admins can trigger pause/unpause.

### 6. Reentrancy Protection

All fund-handling operations should include reentrancy protection:

- **LiquidityPool.move**: Lines 100-200 implement swap operations
- **Protection Method**: Flag-based state locking during operations
- **Critical Functions**:
  - `LiquidityPool::swap`
  - `LiquidityPool::add_liquidity`
  - `LiquidityPool::remove_liquidity`

Ensure that all fund-handling operations implement proper reentrancy guards.

## Common Vulnerability Checklist

Auditors should verify that the codebase is protected against:

1. **Unauthorized Minting**: Ensure only authorized entities can mint tokens
2. **Capability Leakage**: Verify capabilities are not transferable outside intended flows
3. **Timelock Bypasses**: Confirm timelocks cannot be circumvented
4. **Access Control Bypasses**: Check all privileged functions for proper authorization
5. **Arithmetic Errors**: Review all mathematical operations for overflow/underflow
6. **Type Confusion**: Verify proper type handling in all operations
7. **Shared Object Race Conditions**: Check concurrent access to shared objects
8. **Event Emission Consistency**: Ensure all critical operations emit appropriate events

## Audit Preparation

Before starting the audit, we've ensured:

1. **Proper Error Codes**: All functions use descriptive error codes
2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All modules have unit and integration tests
3. **Function-Level Documentation**: All public functions are documented
4. **Authorization Verification**: All privileged operations verify authorization
5. **Invariant Assertions**: Runtime checks for critical invariants

## Testing Guide

The test suite can be run with:

```
sui move test
```

Key test files include:

- **GovernanceAdminTest.move**: Tests admin capability flow
- **TreasuryTimelockTest.move**: Tests treasury timelock functionality
- **EscrowIntegrationTest.move**: Tests escrow transactions and disputes
- **SecurityTest.move**: Specific security-focused tests

## Recent Security Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Admin Registry**: Improved validation for admin capabilities
2. **Emergency Pause Mechanism**: Added system-wide pause functionality
3. **AI-Enhanced Dispute Resolution**: Structured verification for escrow disputes
4. **Detailed Admin Capability Flow Documentation**: Comprehensive security model documentation

- [Move Prover](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/move-prover): Formal verification for Move modules

## Sui-Specific Security Considerations

1. **Object-Centric Security Model**: Ensure proper object ownership and access control
2. **Shared Object Dynamics**: Verify proper handling of shared objects
3. **One-Time Witness Pattern**: Check correct implementation in module initialization
4. **Dynamic Fields**: Verify proper usage for extensible storage
5. **Entry Functions vs Public Functions**: Confirm appropriate function visibility

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Staking APY**: Currently fixed, will be made dynamic in future versions
2. **Enhanced Oracle Integration**: Planned for price feed security in LiquidityPool
3. **Multi-Signature Admin**: Planned upgrade to multi-sig admin capabilities

We welcome all findings and are committed to addressing security issues promptly.
